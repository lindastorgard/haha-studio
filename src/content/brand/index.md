    HAHA studio is the Stockholm based design practice founded by Arash Eskafi
    and Yujin Chiang in 2015. Hailing from different cultures— Scandinavia and
    East Asia— the studio is in constant search of what can be understood by all
    of us, like laughter. HAHA relies on fundamental shapes, choice materials
    and universal truths to design their iconic work. To create objects that all
    of us have an instinctive response to, HAHA works hand in hand with
    craftspeople in Sweden and Taiwan. The practice designs lighting fixtures,
    accessories, limited editions, and undertakes regular collaborations in
    interior architecture.


    The studio's work has been presented by Vitra, FRACAS Gallery, Raumplan, Biennale Interieur and Stockholm Furniture Fair. In 2018 HAHA received the prestigious work grant from the Swedish Arts Committee to add to the definition of Scandinavian design. They have also showcased their work internationally in Brussels, London, Milan, New York, and Shanghai.
