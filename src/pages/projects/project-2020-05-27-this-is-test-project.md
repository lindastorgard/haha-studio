description: HAHA studio is the Stockholm based design practice founded by Arash
  Eskafi and Yujin Chiang in 2015. Hailing from different cultures— Scandinavia
  and East Asia— the studio is in constant search of what can be understood by
  all of us, like laughter. HAHA relies on fundamental shapes, choice materials
  and universal truths to design their iconic work. To create objects that all
  of us have an instinctive response to, HAHA works hand in hand with
  craftspeople in Sweden and Taiwan. The practice designs lighting fixtures,
  accessories, limited editions, and undertakes regular collaborations in
  interior architecture.
