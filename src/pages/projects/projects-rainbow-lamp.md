description: >-
  There is a story behind Rainbow: its shape was not designed, it was found.
  Each part existed for a different purpose before they were united in Rainbow.
  The aluminum elbow is a standard part for the commercial vehicle industry. The
  light itself is a standard LED bulb.


  Fit for ceiling or desk. Rainbow Lamp will be available from August 2019, email us if you are interested in pre-ordering the product.
